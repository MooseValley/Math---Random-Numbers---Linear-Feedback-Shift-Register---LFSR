# Math - Random Numbers - Linear Feedback Shift Register - LFSR

My code / solution to the Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) random numbers generator discussed in the Cimputerphile video:

* Random Numbers with LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) - Computerphile, Sep 10, 2021, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks1pw1X22y4

Really love the Numberphile and Computerphile videos.
Highly recommend them to anyone else out there who loves computers, mathematics, random numbers, Pi, prime numbers, and problem solving.
